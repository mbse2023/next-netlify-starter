    On Monday, over 58,000 houses in New Zealand's upper North Island were without power as Cyclone Gabrielle approached, bringing severe gusts, heavy rain, and massive surf to Auckland and surrounding areas.

Gabrielle passed through the Australian territory of Norfolk Island in the Tasman Sea on Saturday night, while its most devastating gusts spared the island.


It is presently located just north of New Zealand, with weather forecasts forecasting rain and strong gusts as it approaches land on Monday and Tuesday.

"The effect of Gabrielle is still in its early stages, and extra significant and severe weather is still predicted for Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland) later today into Tuesday morning," said Rachel Kelleher, Deputy Controller Auckland Emergency Management, on Monday.

"Now is not the time for complacency," she continued.  
Many schools and local government buildings in Auckland and the upper North Island have closed, and residents are being advised not to go if at all possible. Emergency declarations have been issued in Auckland and at least four other areas.
Metservice reported that Whangarei, a city north of Auckland, has received 100.5 mm of rain (4 inches) in the previous 12 hours, with winds of 159 km/h (100 miles per hour) recorded off the coast of Auckland.

Warning: the following list is certain to elevate your blood pressure, cause your veins to bulge, and perhaps tear your larynx as you scream, 'What the heck are these fools thinking?!' That's the nature of writing about the best movies of all time. Any conversation about movies is certain to get heated, which is a good thing. Few creative forms elicit the same level of zeal from their most ardent supporters as film. Sure, music, literature, and television can all get people fired up. But there is something unique about cinema. Movies live with us in ways that great music and books do not. They influence who we are and how we perceive the world. When you see a favorite movie enough times, it becomes more than simply a creature comfort or a nostalgia trigger; it nearly becomes a lived-in experience.

So, certainly, if you read a list of the greatest movies ever produced and your favorite isn't on it, people might become irritated. Even insane. We embrace it, though, since, as you'll see, we're as passionate. (However, if you must shout at us, please do so in a respectful manner.) We cannot ensure that this list corresponds exactly to your own canon. However, when it comes to genres, eras, regions, and substance, there is something for everyone, from blockbusters to art pictures, cult masterpieces to slapstick comedy, gory actioners to even bloodier horror movies. Even if we strive to cover all the bases, there will undoubtedly be something that will irritate you for one reason or another. And that's fine because rage is caring when it comes to movies. Just make sure you don't chuck your laptop out the window.
